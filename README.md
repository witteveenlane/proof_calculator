This simple whisky-water proof dilution calculator tool is designed to help whisky enthusiasts and professionals accurately calculate the amount of water needed to dilute a given quantity of whisky to a desired proof. The calculator takes into account the initial proof of the whisky and the desired final proof, and provides the user with the exact amount of water needed to achieve the desired dilution.

This tool can be especially useful for whisky lovers who prefer their drinks at a specific proof, as well as for bartenders and distillers who need to accurately dilute whisky for cocktails or blending purposes. The calculator saves time and ensures consistency, as it eliminates the need for manual calculations and guesswork. By using a whisky-water proof dilution calculator, whisky lovers and professionals can ensure that their drinks are perfectly diluted to their desired strength, resulting in a more enjoyable and consistent drinking experience.

The calculator assumes a proof value like that which is used in the United States: twice the percentage of alcohol by volume. For example, a whisky that is 40% ABV (alcohol by volume) would be 80 proof.

The potentially confusing mismatch of measurement systems is intentional. The input is measured in ounces, a typical cocktail/whisky portion measurement in the US. The amount of water necessary to dilute is in ounces, but also mL, which is a common measurement on available eyedroppers. 

Enjoy!
